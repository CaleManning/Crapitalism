# Crapitalism

## Game Overview
Here is a game I made for a class called Crapitalism. It's a minor satire of Capitalism. Make products, go into business with your Grandmother or steal from her. The possibilities could literally be endless.


### World
The world of Crapitalism is full of questionable offers from strangers and new products to create. That's right, if you can think it you can make it. Just make sure you don't run out of money

### Character
You get to play as yourself with a set of custom stats that dictate your ability to interact with strangers. Higher charisma means you'll be more likely to pass tests of character where as a higher intelligence will leave you more likely to pass tests of intellect. 

### Goals
In Crapitalism there's only one goal... make as much money as you can.
